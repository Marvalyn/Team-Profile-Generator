# Team-Profile-Generator

 # Description
  This CLI application uses node.js (including inquirer and jest packages) to generate a html page to display team information about employees on a software engineering team.

  After running 'node index.js' in the command line the user is prompted to enter the Manager's information. After this the user has the choice of adding either an Engineer, an Intern or exiting the programme.

  Once the user exits the programme a HTML page is generated that displays the team member information that has been entered.
